# Detection-of-Thyroid-Disease-with-Classification-Algorithms

* Thyroid disease is a common health problem worldwide.
* As a result of excessive secretion of the thyroid gland, “hyperthyroidism” occurs, and as a result of under-secretion of this gland, “hypothyroidism” occurs.
* To determine the diagnosis of the disease, T3, T4 and TSH values in the blood test are checked.
* Since the symptoms of this disease and the symptoms of other diseases are similar, it is very difficult to detect.
* In this study, it is aimed to detect thyroid disease in a short time by using machine learning classification algorithms and to reduce the patient's time to start treatment.

## Dataset

* In this study, a dataset created with the results of blood tests for the detection of thyroid disease, taken from the UCI machine learning database, was used.
* The dataset consists of 7200 samples.
* 21 number of attributes
* Missing data is not available.
